# AWS IoT

AWS IoT is a platform to easily manage “Internet of Things” devices, also called “things”, permitting them to interact with each other. 
Much like any AWS service, AWS IoT can connect to other AWS cloud applications such as [Lambda](../Lambda). 
Any AWS IoT supported device such as a Raspberry Pi or an AWS IoT Button can be connected to the cloud. In this tutorial, 
we will be creating a virtual device in a computer.
